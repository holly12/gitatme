need a way to discover projects to contribute to - but what about an app that just helps you find open issues/contribs?
----- match people up with contribs based on parameters (what languages do you know?) 

- donate a patch

-- poll for issues, get repo language.

-- find users who specialize in a language who have opted into the service
