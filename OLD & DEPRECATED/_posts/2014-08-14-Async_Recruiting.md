In college, recruiting meant job fairs and shabby suits. In B-school it was a clean shave and writing upside down at case interviews. Since then, I've made slide decks, played ping pong, and met founders at bars. But I always feel uneasy at first interviews.

I think part of the problem is that traditional recruiting is synchronous: you're on the phone, chatting on Skype, or locked in the same room _together_. Conversations can easily turn into interrogations. But what if you took an async approach?

At Union Square Ventures, job applications are short: you submit links that represent you / your work and two brief (<2 min) videos explaining why you're interested in the job & what inspires you. <strong><a href="{{ page.demo }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} Demo">The application looks like this</a></strong>, and funnels everything into a screening queue.

It's not just about saving time either. I think this approach puts introverts & extroverts on an even playing field, encourages high quality applications, and let's candidates be themselves.

Build your own video job application with <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{page.an}}</a></strong>'s open source <strong><a href="{{ page.project }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} on GitHub">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> project. It uses Ziggeo's API for video recording/hosting.
