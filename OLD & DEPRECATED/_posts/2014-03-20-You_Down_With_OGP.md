Sharing links via social media is a pretty mundane task, but have you ever wondered how Google & Facebook always know the exact title, summary, and image to display?

<center><img src="{{page.img}}" alt="Sharing a link on Google+" title="Sharing a link on Google+"></center>Â 

There's some neat tech at work there and it's based on the <strong><a href="{{ page.ogp }}" target="_blank" title="Open Graph Protocol (OGP)">Open Graph Protocol (OGP)</a></strong>. OGP meta tags enable graph-aware apps to see what's behind a link - if you know how to parse them.

Of course, the last thing you want to do is write _yet another_ HTML parser. Luckily, you don't have to!

<strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{ page.an }}</a></strong> already did the work for you with his <strong><a href="{{ page.project }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} on GitHub">{{ page.pn }}</a></strong> Python module. In three lines of code, {{page.pn}} can tell you if a URL has valid OGP tags and output them as HTML or JSON. QED and on to your next challenge!

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
import opengraph

url = opengraph.OpenGraph(url="http://goo.gl/b1CTb3")
url.is_valid()
# returns true since OGP tags are valid

print url.to_json()
# JSON at your service!
