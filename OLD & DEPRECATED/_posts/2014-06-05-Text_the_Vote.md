Last month, 66.4% of India's eligible voters cast their ballots in the general election. In 2012, only 57.5% of US voters showed up at the polls. That's pathetic. We've got 1/5 as many voters and much more <strong><a href="{{ page.nyt }}" target="_blank" title="NYT article - Hikers Spread Democracy in India ">forgiving terrain</a></strong>.
 
I know elections are hard, but we've got all the infrastructure in place for a 100% turnout. Here's my modest proposal: turn every cellphone retailer in America into a polling station and instruct voters to text in their ballots.

<strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{ page.an }}'s</a></strong> <strong><a href="{{ page.project }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} on GitHub">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> is my go-to for text-message polls. Powered by Twilio, it uses SQLite to store results, confirms your vote, and prevents fraud.

Use {{page.pn}} for your next hackathon, student body election, or to <strong><a href="{{ page.vote }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} Demo Poll">support your favorite programming language</a></strong>.
