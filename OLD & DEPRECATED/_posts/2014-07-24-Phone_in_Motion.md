I like hackathons for two reasons: 

1. They facilitate massive creativity in minimal time.
2. The demos and awards are often just the beginning. 

A great example of this is <strong><a href="{{ page.project }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} on GitHub">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, created by <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{page.an}}</a></strong> and his team at <strong><a href="{{ page.hackfest }}" target="_blank" title="GreylockU's Hackfest">GreylockU's Hackfest</a></strong>.

{{page.pn}} is an interaction library for mobile browsers. Instead of capturing touch gestures, it enables motion controls using your entire phone. Want to flick your phone to fire a callback? Done. How about tilt scrolling with just 1 line of code? Easy. XYZ orientation tracking? You know it. 

With all the tedious bits wrapped up in a neat API, {{page.pn}} will have you up and running in a snap. This library is really fun and very hackable. <strong><a href="{{ page.demo }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} demos">Check out the demos on your phone</a></strong>.

FYI, the project is active and looking for pull requests / suggestions, so get on it!
