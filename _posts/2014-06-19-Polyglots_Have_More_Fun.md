After watching a few World Cup games at bars, it's clear to me that polyglots have more fun. I speak Spanish well enough to get around, but I wish that I'd taken Latin, French, and Hindi more seriously. But really, who has the time to learn another language?

Fortunately, {{ page.an }}'s Chrome extension <strong><a href="{{ page.project }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} on GitHub">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> is helping me turn everyday web browsing into a learning opportunity. Here's how it works: click the frog button, select some text, see the translation. That's it!

{{page.pn}} is an elegant and useful tool for inline translations. Frankly, I'm shocked that it only had two stars on GitHub. Here it is in action:

<center><img src="{{page.img}}" alt="{{page.pn}} in action" title="{{page.pn}} in action" style="border:1px solid #021a40;"></center>

<center><a href="{{page.webstore}}" class="btn btn-primary " title="Get {{page.pn}} at the Chrome Web Store" target="_blank" >Install {{page.pn}}</a> <a href="{{ page.url }}#comments" class="btn btn-inverse" title="Discuss this issue of Git @ Me online">Join discussion</a></center>
