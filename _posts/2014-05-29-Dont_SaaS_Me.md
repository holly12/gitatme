A SaaS salesman recently pitched me on an 'enterprise class' URL shortener. Despite commoditization in the past 5 years, this service, which includes analytics, custom branding, and an API, costs $1,000/month. 

Yikes on bikes! SaaS businesses are supposed to be a cost/benefit slam dunk. Was $12K/year really cheaper than doing it myself? Nope.

With <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{ page.an }}</a></strong>'s <strong><a href="{{ page.project }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} on GitHub">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, I can get the same 'enterprise class' features without the price tag. All it takes is a domain name, web host, PHP, and MySQL. That should all cost less than $15/month.
