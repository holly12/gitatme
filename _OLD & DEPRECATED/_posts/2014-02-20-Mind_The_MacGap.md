Have you ever written a JavaScript webapp? Yes? Awesome. How about a desktop app? Like a 'double click on this icon to launch it' app. No? Me neither &mdash; until last week.


With <strong><a href="{{ page.project }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} on GitHub">{{ page.pn }}</a></strong> from <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{ page.an }}</a></strong>, it only took me 20 minutes to convert my webapp, <strong><a href="{{page.webapp}}" title=" Bossmode web app" target="_blank">Bossmode</a></strong>, into a <strong><a href="{{page.app}}" title="Download Bossmode for OSX" target="_blank">stand alone .app</a></strong> for OSX.

Since the app was built in CSS/JS/HTML, I didn't have to learn Objective-C, rebuild the interface, or give up my responsive Bootstrap layout.

MacGap is comprised of two things: 

1. An Xcode project that wraps your webapp in a Webview container
2. A JavaScript API for OS resources (e.g. clipboard & notifications)

After copying your source into the `/public` directory and fixing any resource / path issues, you'll be able to compile & run it from the desktop. And bonus &mdash; you can publish it in the App Store!
