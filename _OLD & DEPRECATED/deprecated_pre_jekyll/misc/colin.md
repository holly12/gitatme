Call with Colin Nederkoorn

1. are newsletters better written with a personal or 3rd party voice? -- we switched our ADstruc newsletters to a more personal voice (but not the subject lines) and readership went down.
 - personal approach can be a strength
 - establish your persona and character either way
 - build trust with audience
 - can try a/b testing 1st/3rd person for a couple posts, or with friends in advance.

2. mobile first? mobile only design? how important is desktop email at this point?
 - upon signup for colin's newsletter, confirm email stats: 52% desktop, 34% web, 14% mobile
 - make sure you're mobile ready - consider MC templates
 - blog is important, syndicate to it, don't truncate content in email
 - not selling anything, so no reason to hold back on blog - give them all the content in multiple ways

3. how much feedback do you get from the customer.io newsletter? 
 - feedback is lumpy
 - lack of feedback isn't indicative of much
 - 40-50% open rate for colin's newsleters which are weekly and opt-in
 - test frequency, but shoot for once a week
 - if you don't have good quality though, lower frequency
 
4. is there a checklist / pre-email-sending worksheet to consider? 
 - send test to self
 - read on a few platforms (desktop/tablet/mobile)
 - test links
 - revise
 - get someone else to read it
 
5. how important is the editorial? i want to be brief, and get to the point: this project does X, is written in Y, and you can check it out by clicking on Z. 

6. how do you prep readers for the eventual advertising idea?
 - focus on content / value first
 - ads aren't a big deal though, so a text ad/banner isn't a huge imposition
 - start without it.

7. other resources
 - brian waggoner (dailypass, tinyshift) newsletters, monetizes with advertising
 - rails cast
